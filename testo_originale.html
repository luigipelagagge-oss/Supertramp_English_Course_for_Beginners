So you think you're a Romeo
Playing a part in a picture-show?
Well, you're the joke of the neighborhood
Why should you care if you're feeling good?

And you're the joke of the neighborhood
Why should you care?

<div class="chorus">Take the long way home
Take the long way home</div>

You're the joke of the neighborhood
Why should you care if you're feeling good?

Does it feel that your life's become a catastrophe?
Oh, it has to be for you to grow, boy
When you look through the years and see what you could have been
Oh, what you might have been
If you'd had more time

So when the day comes to an end
And you've got to find a friend
Ain't it nice to know
You've got the long way home?

<div class="chorus">Take the long way home
Take the long way home</div>

You never see what you want to see
Forever playing to the gallery
You take the long way home
Take the long way home

And when you're up on the stage, it's time to go
You know you've got to leave them all, the show
Ain't it nice to know
You've got the long way home?

<div class="chorus">Take the long way home
Take the long way home</div>

You take the long way home
You take the long way home
